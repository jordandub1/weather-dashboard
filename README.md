# Jordan's Weather Dashboard   

This application was created to pull the current and future weather forecasts for any US city and save the recent searches locally. 

## Motivation

* I created this weather application to easily view the weather forecasts for any US city and view the next 5 days of weather forecasts as well. I also added a feature to save the recent city searches so that I do not have to re-type cities every time. 

## Lessons Learned

* How to pull information using an API call.
* How to manipulate the data pulled to display only what is needed for the application. 
  
## Challenges

* The most challenging aspect of this application was creating the API calls and creating the function to display the information onto the page from the call.
